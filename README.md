# Face Recognition
This reposotory is part of a project to figure out face recognition algorithms that work best on IOT.
- It should be able to recognize if a face is present or not. 
- It needs to work concurrently on large dataset.
##TODO
  - familiarize with opencv 2(latest version to work on raspberry pi)
  - find two algorithms used as neural networks in image recognition
  - compare the performance of the two algorithms
  - extract the criteria for imporovement from comparison
  - search for other face recognition algorithms
  - find a problem that is not solved by any of the encountered algorithms
  - check IEEE and arxiv
  - implement a solution
  - compare performance with the original algorithm
